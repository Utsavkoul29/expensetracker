Steps
HTML:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head <title>Expense Tracker</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
<h1>Expense Tracker</h1>

<div class="add-expense-form">
<input type="text" id="expense-name" placeholder="Expense Name">
<input type="number" id="expense-amount" placeholder="Expense Amount">
<button id="add-expense-btn">Add Expense</button>
</div>

<div id="expense-list">
<!-- Expense items will be dynamically added here -->
</div>

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
In the HTML, we have a form to add expenses. The expense name and amount are input fields, and there's a button to add the expense. We also have a `<div>` to display the list of expenses, which will be dynamically populated later.

CSS (styles.css):
```
.add-expense-form input,
.add-expense-form button {
margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.add-expense-form input[type="text"],
.add-expense-form input[type="number"] {
width: 200px;
padding: 5px;
}

#expense-list {
margin-top: 20px;
}
```
In the CSS, we style the form inputs and button, and add some margin and padding to make it visually appealing. We also add some margin to the expense list.

JavaScript + jQuery (script.js):
```
$(document).ready(function() {
// When the "Add Expense" button is clicked
$('#add-expense-btn').click(function() {
// Retrieve the input values
var expenseName = $('#expense-name').val();
var expenseAmount = $('#expense-amount').val();

// Validate the input
if (expenseName === '' || expenseAmount === '') {
alert('Please enter both the expense name and amount.');
return;
}

// Prepare the data to be sent to the server
var data = {
name: expenseName,
amount: expenseAmount
};

// Send the data to the server using Ajax
$.ajax({
url: 'add_expense.php',
method: 'POST',
data: data,
success: function(response) {
// Add the new expense item to the list
$('#expense-list').append('<div>' + expenseName + ' - $' + expenseAmount + '</div>');

// Clear the input fields
$('#expense-name').val('');
$('#expense-amount').val('');
}
});
});
});
```
In JavaScript, we use jQuery to handle events. Here, we listen for a click event on the "Add Expense" button. We retrieve the values of the expense name and amount input fields, validate them, and prepare the data to be sent to the server. We then make an Ajax request to the add_expense.php file, passing the data. On successful response from the server, we add the new expense item to the expense list div and clear the input fields.

PHP (add_expense.php):
```php
<?php
// Retrieve the data sent from the client
$name = $_POST['name'];
$amount = $_POST['amount'];

// Do some validation and processing with the data
// ...

// Return a response indicating success or failure
$success = true;
if ($success) {
echo 'Expense added successfully!';
} else {
echo 'Failed to add the expense.';
}
?>
```
In PHP, we receive the data sent from the client via the Ajax request. We can then perform validation, processing, and saving to a database (not included in this example). Finally, we return a response indicating whether the expense was successfully added or not.

You would need to set up a server environment (e.g., Apache, PHP) to run the PHP portion of the code.

Remember to save the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code in separate files with the appropriate file extensions (.html, .css, .js, .php).
